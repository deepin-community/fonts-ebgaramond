<h1>EB Garamond</h1>
Claude Garamont’s designs go open source<br>

<p>Garamont’s fonts represent a milestone in the history of type design, a
touchstone to which font designers have been returning ever since. EB&nbsp;Garamond is an open source project to create a revival of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Garamond" title="«Claude Garamond» in the english Wikipedia">Claude Garamont</a>’s famous humanist typeface from the mid-16<span class="sup">th</span> century. Its design reproduces the original by Claude Garamont: The source for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen known as the “Berner specimen”, which, composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, son-in-law of Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff print office, shows Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic fonts at different sizes. Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond.</p>

<h2>Why another Garamond?</h2>
<p>The Garamonds are probably the most copied typefaces in the world. There are indeed lots of excellent Garamond fonts, also such that try to approach the original in the same way as EB Garamond does. In the world of free software, however, only a few Garamond-inspired fonts exist, and as far as I know, none with the scope of EB Garamond. I know that competition is tough in this field, and these fonts won’t be able to stand up to their commercial counterparts for quite some time. Nevertheless, it’s time for the opensource community to have a classical Garamond and I promise, i’ll try hard to learn and give my best.</p>
